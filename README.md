# SpacePics

A new Flutter app that shows pictures from NASA's "Astronomy Picture of the Day".

## Requirements

Requirements defined by CloudWalk:

- Have two screens: a list of the images and a detail screen
- The images list must display the title, date and provide a search field in the top (find by title or date)
- The detail screen must have the image and the texts: date, title and explanation
- Must work offline (will be tested with airplane mode)
- Must support multiple resolutions and sizes
- Regarding the screen with the list, it would be nice to have pull-to-refresh and pagination features
